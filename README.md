# Topic Switcher
A simple Topic Switching app, great for podcasts and discussion videos/livestreams.

### Getting Started
- Download the latest archive by [clicking here](https://github.com/xlxAciDxlx/Topic-Switcher/archive/master.zip)
- Unzip it using your preferred archive manager (Win-Rar, 7Zip, etc)
- Open `topics.txt` in your favorite text editor (I recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)) and add your topics, one topic per line
- Save any edited files
- Right click on `index.html` and open in your web browser of choice
- *Optional:* If you'd like to customize the look and feel, open up `assets/css/style.css`

#### Capturing with OBS
- To capture your topic list with OBS, simply add a Browser Source and copy the URL that your browser took you to when you opened `index.html`
